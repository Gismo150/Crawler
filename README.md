# GitHub Crawler

This Crawler allows you to collect the repository metadata of public repositories published on Github.

The Crawler creates a "Repositories.json" file. This file contains an Json Array, where each element the repository metadata of matching repositories stores.
Specify the programming language you are interested in within the Config.properties file.
